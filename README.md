# MVC-Bank-Application

The objective is to develop a robust web-based banking application that facilitates the secure management of user accounts and transactions. The application will serve two types of users: Administrators (Admins) and Customers. Admins will have the ability to manage user accounts and view transaction details, while Customers will be able to conduct financial transactions and view their transaction history through an online passbook.
